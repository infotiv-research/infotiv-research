## Autonomous driving via imitation learning in a small-scale automotive platform

This work presents an implementation of IL for achieving autonomous driving on a go-kart platform. Leveraging both behavioral cloning (BC) and Human Gated Dataset Aggregation (HG-DAgger), we compare the impact of using an interactive IL algorithm HG-DAgger compared to BC. Additionally, our research explores the use of different inputs, including color camera, stereo depth camera, IMU, and the position of ORB features. We also detail the development of a comprehensive software pipeline encompassing data collection, data formatting, model training, and go-kart control.

### Purpose of the study
To save time and reduce the costs, the Verification and Validation of ADS (Autonomous Driving System) are mostly done in realistic simulators to capture potential hazards before these components are tested in the real worlds testing tracks. 
In two research projects with the focus of Verification and Validation of automated systems, Infotiv is interested to experiment using open-source simulator such as ESMINI, SVL and CARLA for testing autonomous driving systems (such as openpilot and Apollo Baidu) that are using machine learning.

Keywords: Verification and Validation, Simulation, C++, Python, testing machine learning based systems

Please fid more information about this thesis in this link (https://infotiv-research.github.io/)

### Potential Research questions
 - Scenario and scene creations using standards formats (such as OpenDRIVE and OpenSCENARIO) to describe the environment and the agent's behavior in simulators. We are potentially interested to implement a scenario editor based on ESMINI. (https://github.com/esmini/esmini)
 - Realistic graphical 3D models of a realistic urban environment in SVL (based on Unity) and CARLA (based on Unreal engine) simulators.

     * https://www.svlsimulator.com/

The above research questions are examples, and the proposal will be tailored to the specific candidates

### Recommended skills/programme
 - Skills: C++, Python
 - Programme: Computer Science/ Interaction Design /Automation and Mechatronics

### Other information
 - Number of students: 1-2
 - The thesis project will be carried out as part of the work within the research projects Infotiv are involved in. Other thesis projects on similar projects will be held to provide a collaborative environment. Infotiv will provide supervision both in terms of technical aspects as working environment and teamwork.

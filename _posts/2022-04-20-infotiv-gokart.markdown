To increase the knowledge and expertise within the evolving automotive industry Infotiv developed the IES Education Platform. A multitude of thesis works, internships and internal projects have been done with this platform and this has bettered Infotivâ€™s competitive edge.

Developing an autonomous driving platform that is closer to a real car opens a multitude of developing opportunities as well as increasing the value of the existing project. The research and development done on the new go-kart will face more similar issues as the industry is facing.

The goal of the project is to add a driver assistance system capable of performing basic functions such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) to the existing GoKart framework. The GoKart was the result of previous research within Infotiv and supports the following sensors and actuators.

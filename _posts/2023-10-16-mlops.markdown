Infotiv TechDev has machine learning models
that require continuous maintenance. We are in
search of an automation engineer who
possesses an interest in both data management
and data engineering that can help us keep the
quality of our code, data and model at the same
level. This automation engineer will be
responsible for researching various alternative
platforms, and designing and executing the
required automations within them. Our
objective is to develop a forward-looking
solution that remains applicable to our
upcoming projects as well.We are looking for 2 master students with a
background in computer engineering,
engineering mathematics, engineering physics or
equivalent program, who wish to conduct their
thesis during the spring of 2024. Applicants shall
have experience in machine learning, software
development and image processing. Applicants
shall also have experience from programming
languages such as C++ or Python, and it is
meritorious to have previous experience from or
knowledge of data analysis and collection.
The primary purpose of this project is to
internally research and deploy the necessary
infrastructure and seamlessly integrate our
existing system within it.

## SMILE III, IV (Safety analysis and verification/validation of ML based systems)

- Future autonomous vehicles will rely on Deep machine learning algorithms (DML), whose correct behaviour cannot be guaranteed by traditional software engineering approaches ​
- SMILE III project tries to develop method(s) that allow DML-based functions to be included into safety critical vehicular applications with quality control requirements from industrial standards.​

## VALU3S (Verification and Validation of Automated Systems' Safety and Security​)

- VALU3S aims to design, implement and evaluate state-of-the-art V&V methods and tools​
- VALU3S brings together a consortium with partners from 10 different countries​
    - industrial partners (24 partners) from automotive, agriculture, railway, healthcare, aerospace and industrial automation and robotics domains ​
    - leading research institutes (6 partners) ​
    - universities (10 partners) ​


## ARTWORK​ (The smart and connected worker)
ARTWORK is developing a real-time assistance system for workers in plants who still work with their hands to build customised products like trucks and machines.​
The solution will comprise ​

- digital Twins of factory workers and equipment​
- smart instruction generation​
- a worker feedback system.​

The goal is to connect workers to the production line and enable automatic derivation of process instructions based on the context​

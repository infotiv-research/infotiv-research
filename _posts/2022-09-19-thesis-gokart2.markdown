### Purpose of the study
To increase the knowledge and expertise within the evolving automotive industry, Infotiv Technology Development AB developed the open and educational autonomous platform. The goal of the platform is to have an autonomous gokart that progresses research and development in the automotive industry. Currently, the system is designed in three modules, an Automotive platform that implements the core driving functionality (steering, throttle, and brake) through the CAN. Body electronics include lights, sensors, a horn, and a monitor displaying the platform power mode and a simulated key. Finally, the autonomous drive module runs openpilot for basic driving assistant functionalities using one camera. Please read more about the autonomous platform at
